# Bike Sharing Analysis Project

---
This project analyzes bike sharing data to uncover patterns in rental behavior. We explore factors such as seasonality,
weather conditions, and time patterns that influence bike rentals.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. Which season has the highest number of bike rentals?
2. How do weather conditions affect rental patterns?
3. What are the peak hours for bike rentals?
4. How do weekday rentals compare to weekend rentals?
5. What yearly trends can we observe in the rental data?
